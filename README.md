# house_price

House price prediction â€“ data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering and machine learning(supervised)
Using dataset about the houses and their price in Bangalore, India, I did the progressive data preprocessing and visualization for further analysis by the help of the pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries. The main purpose of this project is to predict the prices of the houses using machine learning, so I used 3 ML of supervised learning(regression): lasso, ridge and linear regression and I did grid search to use the best hyperparameters for ML using sklearn library.
